# About me {#about}

**Docent (associate professor), licensed clinical psychologist, PhD**  
Stockholm, Sweden  

I work at **Karolinska University Hospital** as an operations developer, focusing on clinical digitalization. Also, I have a research affiliation at **Karolinska Institutet**. My background spans leadership in healthcare, applying and implementing clinical psychology within healthcare, research within the field of behavioral medicine and chronic pain. These days I split my time between **clinical digitalisation**, **research**, and explorations of how I can contribute towards **AI** safety and ethics.

## What I do {#what}

**Clinical digitalisation**  
  - I support and facilitate the development, implementation and evaluation of **digital and hybrid clinical solutions and workflows** at Karolinska University Hospital. This includes the digitalization of assessments procedures and interventions provided by health care professionals.

**Research**  
  - Internetbased Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for longstanding pain in youth.  
  - Studies on **ME/CFS** and **post-COVID-19 condition**, including symptom profiles, sickness behaviour, and rehabilitation.  
  - Moving toward research on the development and evaluation of **applied AI-based solutions** in the healthcare context, and **non-technical AI safety**.

## What I’m currently focusing on {#curios-about} 
- Under the assumption that these systems are realisable, I'm aiming to understand the arguments concluding that there are substantial risks in the near and long-term in developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), as well as the theoretical work that has been done to formulate strategies for the development of safe such systems (AGI, ASI), and how we can mitigate risks related to the development and proliferation of such systems. Additionally, assuming we find a way to safely enough navigate the development and integration of such systems into society - what could such a world look like?
