# About me {#about}

**Docent (associate professor), licensed clinical psychologist, PhD**  
Stockholm, Sweden  

I work at **Karolinska University Hospital** as an operations developer, focusing on clinical digitalization. Also, I have a research affiliation at <a href="https://ki.se/en/people/mike-kemani-2">**Karolinska Institutet**</a>. My background spans leadership in healthcare, applying and implementing clinical psychology within healthcare, research within the field of behavioral medicine and chronic pain. These days I split my time between **clinical digitalization**, **research**, and explorations of how I can contribute towards **AI safety and ethics**.

## What I do {#what}

**Clinical digitalisation**  
  - I support and facilitate the development, implementation, and evaluation of **digital and hybrid clinical solutions and workflows** at Karolinska University Hospital. This includes the digitalization of assessment procedures and interventions provided by healthprofessionals.

**Research**  
  - Internet-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for longstanding pain in youth.  
  - Studies on **ME/CFS** and **post-COVID-19 condition**, including symptom profiles, and rehabilitation.
  - Studies related to **rehabiliation in lumbar fusion surgery**.
  - Moving toward research on the development and evaluation of **applied AI-based solutions** in the healthcare context, and **non-technical AI safety**.
  - Exploring ways to contribute researchwise, in investigating mis-/dis-/malinformation and conspiracy thinking, and more specifically in relation to new technology and healthcare.

## What I’m currently exploring {#curios-about} 
Under the assumption that these systems are realizable, I'm aiming to understand the arguments concluding that there are substantial risks in the near and long-term in developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), as well as the theoretical work that has been done to formulate strategies for the development of safe such systems (AGI, ASI), and how we can mitigate risks related to the development and proliferation of such systems. Additionally, assuming we find a way to safely enough navigate the development and integration of such systems into society - what could such a world look like? Lastly, I'm interested in better understanding the cognitive and psychological (from a behavioral perspective) aspects related to effective conveying and acceptance of mis-/dis-/malinformation and, conspiracy thinking, especially in relation to the fields of new technology and healthcare.
