# Hi, I'm Mike

**Docent (Associate Professor), Licensed Clinical Psychologist, PhD**  
Stockholm, Sweden  

I work at **Karolinska University Hospital** and am affiliated with **Karolinska Institutet**. My background spans leadership in healthcare, applying and implementing clinical psychology within healthcare, research within the field of behavioural medicine and chronic pain. These days I split my time between **clinical digitalisation**, **research**, and exploring how **AI** can be used responsibly in healthcare.

---

## What I do

  - **Clinical psychology & behavioural medicine**  
  - Longstanding focus on chronic pain, and ACT-based constructs, processes and interventions.  
  - Clinical experience delivering cognitive behavioural interventions in specialised healthcare settings.

  - **Clinical digitalisation / service development**  
  - Supporting the development of **digital and hybrid clinical workflows** at Karolinska University Hospital.  
  - Interested in how digital tools reshape clinical workflows, day-to-day clinical work and patient experiences and outcomes.

  - **Research**  
  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for longstanding pain (doctoral work).  
  - Psychometric evaluation of self-report measures in chronic pain and healthcare contexts.  
  - Studies on **ME/CFS** and **post-COVID-19 condition**, including symptom profiles, sickness behaviour, and rehabilitation.  

  - **AI & healthcare**  
  - Moving toward research on **applied clinical AI-based solutions** and **non-technical AI safety**.  
  - Curious about how AI can be integrated into real-world clinical workflows without losing sight of ethics, safety, and patients’ lived experience.

## Research interests (selected)

- Chronic pain, ACT, psychological flexibility  
- Digital and hybrid care models  
- Psychometrics and outcome measurement in healthcare  
- Post COVID-19 condition and ME/CFS  
- AI in healthcare, clinical decision support, and documentation tools  
- Non-technical AI safety and the broader implications of AI for healthcare systems

---

## Tools & methods I use

- **Statistics & AI-assisted R programming**: R (longitudinal models, mixture/latent class models, psychometrics). 
- **Study designs**: RCTs, longitudinal observational studies, psychometric validation, feasibility and implementation studies. 
- 📝 **Writing & documentation**: Structured, reproducible workflows; strong preference for transparent methods and open, well-documented code/analysis when possible.

## What I’m currently curious about

- How clinical AI tools actually behave “in the wild” – in real clinics, with real constraints.  
- Practical ways to evaluate **AI safety** and robustness from a non-technical/clinical perspective.  
- How to design digital interventions and workflows that respect both clinicians’ reality and patients’ values.
